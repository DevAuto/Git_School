    Top level context object for the CLI. Exposes common functionality required by a CLI, including logging,
    environment config parsing, debug logging etc.

    This object is passed by Click to every command that adds the proper annotation.
    Read this for more details on Click Context - http://click.pocoo.org/5/commands/#nested-handling-and-contexts
    Each command gets its own context object, but linked to both parent and child command's context, like a Linked List.

    This class itself does not rely on how Click works. It is just a plain old Python class that holds common
    properties used by every CLI command.
